# DESCRIPTION
This repository contains all code described in our recent manuscript. It includes the curation of diverse RNA datasets from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB), prediction of optimal growth temperature (OGT) phenotypes, and the application of GPT and GNN models for the development of thermostable ribosomes. These resources include examples for dataset preprocessing, the generation of training and test sets utilizing hierarchical clustering with CD-HIT, and model validation. This project is a community effort coordinated by The Innovative Genomics Institute and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California Berkeley.
