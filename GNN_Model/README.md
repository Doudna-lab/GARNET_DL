# Graph-Based RNA Sequence Modeling

The idea is to model RNA using either attention based on the 2D or 3D information.
This can be particularly helpful for ribosomal RNA, which is very long making full attention expensive computationally. Furthermore, the inductive bias from 2D or 3D information should result in better modeling of the RNA.

This repo is based heavily on ideas and code from [Generative Models for Graph-Based Protein Design](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9711-generative-models-for-graph-based-protein-design) by John Ingraham, Vikas Garg, Regina Barzilay and Tommi Jaakkola, NeurIPS 2019.
